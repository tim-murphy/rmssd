# rmssd
Test routine for assessing rounding errors when calculating the Root Mean Square of Successive RR-interval Differences (RMSSD).

This very basic program calculates RMSSD manually with 32-, 64-, and 128-bit floating point data types.
This demonstrates the rounding errors of using each type.

Simply compile the code (CMake or manually compiling the two source files) and run. The binary needs to be in the rmssd directory
in order to find the test input file.
